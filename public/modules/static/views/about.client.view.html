					<h1>Definition - SenseForage</h1>
					<p>SenseForage is a platform with the ultimate goal of achieving happiness while benefiting others. The main categories of topics we cover are: cultures around the world, involvement within a community, and improvement of one’s self.</p>
					<p>We do not consider ourselves as a lifestyle website simply because life is more multifaceted than to live a luxurious life. </p>

					<h1>Happiness - from within, not from others</h1>
					<p>Exceeding the requirements of the term “Cultural Creatives”, defined by Paul H. Ray and Sherry Ruth Anderson, SenseForage is a platform that satisfies the craving of the modern-day intellects to make the world a better place. </p>
					<p>Once the most basic human needs have been satiated, one can say the most fundamental aspects of life have been secured. However, there lies one important aspect that is often ignored -- relationship building. Through reaching out to understand others and looking within to understand one’s own self, one can finally stop looking for happiness from others, but rather start generating happiness from within.</p>

					<h1>The magic number - 3</h1>
					<p>Here at SenseForage, we believe that everything can be broken down into 3 components. Yes, 3 components. 3 is the magic number that seems to work with everything in perfect harmony.</p>
					<p>Relationships can be divided into 3 circles - one’s self, people surrounding you, everyone else around the world.</p>
					<p>Happiness can be gathered in 3 different ways - improving yourself, making the environment around you better, and understanding people from a different background.</p>
					<p>Us, Foragers , want to be happy, and sharing information from around the globe is how we intend on creating our own happiness. So please, help us feel great ourselves through feeling great yourself.</p>
